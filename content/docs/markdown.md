[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to [simplify writing](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/writing-markdown.html) content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.
The basics are intuitive, you can learn in about a minute!
See [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html) to get started.

Any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.
Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

Code can be highlighted with `backticks`.
Hyperlinks look like [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).
You can add footnotes.[^1]
